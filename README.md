# barc_lib

This repo contains functions and types that are used by both the Barc simulation framework and the "real" ROS framework.
It contains basic BARC-specific types (related to the model and to MPC functions) and functions for their initialization. There are also functions to simulate the car's dynamics and to control the car along a racetrack (using Learning Model Predictive Control).
The library should be structured in folders according to its purposes.
